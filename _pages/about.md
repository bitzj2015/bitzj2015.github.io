Biography
=========
I am a Research Scientist at Meta. Previously, I completed my PhD degree in EE at [University of Southern California](https://homeadmin.usc.edu/www/) in 2024, supervised by Prof. [Konstantinos Psounis](https://sites.usc.edu/kpsounis/). During my PhD study at USC, I also received two Master's Degree of Science (EE and CS). My research interests focus on enhancing the privacy and security of ML systems, with applications in online advertising, recommendation systems, and large foundation models.
