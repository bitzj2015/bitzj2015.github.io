Biography
=========
I am a second-year Electrical Engineering Phd student at University of Southern California, supervised by [Prof. Konstantinos Psounis](https://sites.usc.edu/kpsounis/). I received my Bachelor's Degree of Science in Automation from [Beijing Institute of Technology](http://www.bit.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Xia Yuanqing](http://ac.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsdw/20150206132638749920/20150206132641418489/index.htm) and [Prof. Yufeng Zhan](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Yufeng-Zhan-2084865154).
